command line arguments: ./as2 < inputs/input-01

we show the speed differences due to our optimization by varying:
(x be any positive integer)
leaf size of Bounding Volume Hierarchy (command "leaf x")
number of samples per pixel used to anti-aliase (command "aa x")
threads usd (command "t x")


The following are several combintaion of setups we run, with time recorded:

leaf 100000
aa 1
t 1

Time taken to construct BVH of 3192 primitives: 0ms
Time taken to render with 1 thread: 98417ms

leaf 4 (originally 100000)
aa 1
t 1

Time taken to construct BVH of 3192 primitives: 3ms
Time taken to render with 1 threads: 1311ms

leaf 4
aa 1
t 8 (originally 1)

Time taken to construct BVH of 3192 primitives: 4ms
Time taken to render with 8 threads: 391ms
