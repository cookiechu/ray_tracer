command line arguments: ./as2 < inputs/input-02

we show the speed differences due to our optimization by varying:
(x be any positive integer)
leaf size of Bounding Volume Hierarchy (command "leaf x")
number of samples per pixel used to anti-aliase (command "aa x")
threads usd (command "t x")

continued from note-01, we use the same picture but vary the aa(anti-aliasing)

leaf 4
aa 400
t 8
